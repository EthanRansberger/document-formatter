Dear Hiring Manager,

Over the Summer of 2023, I interned for the Navy Exchange IT department, gaining a surplus of exposure to applications across all aspects of the company's mission. These software include TOAD for SQL server, PeopleSoft, and AppWorx, and I also did back-end debugging in Java, HTML, and C++ using various IDEs. While working there, I took the initiative over creative solutions to contribute the most to a company with a high security and information safety standard. I worked with SharePoint to update my teams' document databases and assisted in creating support documents in Word, configuring Excel spreadsheets, and making professional PowerPoint presentations. I have also shadowed and assisted in mergers from within the company's program repositories for store systems and financial applications used to pay thousands of employees.

I am currently working on completing my Bachelor of Arts in Economics with a certificate in Elements of Computing at the University of Texas in Austin. I am on track to graduate on time on May 11, 2024. I have gained a wealth of knowledge in statistics, energy economics, data science, econometrics, and upper-level computer science experiences in software development using languages such as Python or C++, algorithms, processing, and data visualization and regression tools such as Stata or R Studio. This vast but high-level cross-disciplinary experience gives me a unique approach and skill set that is efficient, economical, and technologically literate.

Thank you for your time and consideration. I have attached my resume and letter and will gladly schedule an interview with you soon.

Sincerely,  
Ethan Ransberger
